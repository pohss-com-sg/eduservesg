# EduServeSG
### This project was made for GESS's Capstone+ in 2023. 
Thank you, Shaquille, Trio, Gavin and Wen Qian, for being... _interesting_ teammates.
> EduServeSG is meant to help teachers in administrating students when they are not around.

## General Information
> Teachers are getting more burned-out due to them having to do too much work. Work may include marking test papers, pressure from parents/guardians or authorities, as well as doing too much administrative work and trying to maintain classroom discipline. Burnout may lead to a lack of motivation to continue teaching, decreasing the quality of education, making students feel less inspired to learn.

### What we Want to Achieve
- Minimise, or even eliminate the harmful noise in schools
- Effectively reduce the issue of discipline in classrooms, by making sure teachers don’t have to disrupt the class to reprimand one student, not being very labourous
- Cost-effective and simple to use, yet lasts at least a few years

## Ideation
- Monitors students’ noise and sees noise level
- If noise level reaches a certain level, make a sound so all students or teachers(if one is there) in the classroom of the noise level
- After 1 minute, if noise in classroom is still high, sends another sound 
- Every sound sent, one point is added to class
- Class above a certain number of points get punishment, classes below a certain number of points get rewards, if all classes have points below a certain number of points, pizza party for whole level!(or any other suitable reward)(enables interclass cooperation and peer pressure to reduce noise level)

## Prototype
We used **python and pyaudio** as a platform to act as a median between the external mic and laptop speakers, and to house the code.

### Demonstration

## Discussion
* Our prototype mainly benefits the students that want to study when no teacher is around and also helps reduce the need of Teachers having to come over and watch the class.
* The current InAudible prototype does not cost much as it is only powered by a microbit and simple components.
* However, we may enhance the display with larger and more visible graphics on larger screens to improve visibility for the whole class, and these may be costly to install.

### inAudible enhances leadership qualities in each student, and helps them concentrate on work when no teacher is around. There are some possible improvements to this system for future iterations, to improve effectiveness.
