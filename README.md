# EduServeSG
### This project was made for GESS's Capstone+ in 2023. 
Thank you, Shaquille, Trio, Gavin and Wen Qian, for being... _interesting_ teammates.
> EduServeSG is meant to help teachers in administrating students when they are not around.

## General Information
> Teachers are getting more burned-out due to them having to do too much work. Work may include marking test papers, pressure from parents/guardians or authorities, as well as doing too much administrative work and trying to maintain classroom discipline. Burnout may lead to a lack of motivation to continue teaching, decreasing the quality of education, making students feel less inspired to learn.

### What we Want to Achieve
- Minimise, or even eliminate the harmful noise in schools
- Effectively reduce the issue of discipline in classrooms, by making sure teachers don’t have to disrupt the class to reprimand one student, not being very labourous
- Cost-effective and simple to use, yet lasts at least a few years

## Ideation
- Monitors students’ noise and sees noise level
- If noise level reaches a certain level, make a sound so all students or teachers(if one is there) in the classroom of the noise level
- After 1 minute, if noise in classroom is still high, sends another sound 
- Every sound sent, one point is added to class
- Class above a certain number of points get punishment, classes below a certain number of points get rewards, if all classes have points below a certain number of points, pizza party for whole level!(or any other suitable reward)(enables interclass cooperation and peer pressure to reduce noise level)

## Prototype
We used **python and pyaudio** as a platform to act as a median between the external mic and laptop speakers, and to house the code.

### Demonstration

## Discussion
### What do you think of EduServeSG?
- It can help monitor students’ activities during periods where a teacher is not around
- the current prototype is rather cost-effective due to its part list 
- It reduces total noise in school, through peer pressure, social unrest, punishment, and rewards.
- Improves overall mood in school, reducing stress caused by noise
- Provides optimal learning environment, reducing noise
- Improves public image of school
### What are some limitations?
- The methods used by EduserveSG may be controversial, in terms of morality. However, we have class cleanliness, which is quite a similar system, so I believe the morality of this is absolutely fine.
### What could be some further expansions/improvements made?
- Have a whole separate prototype for this, instead of using laptops of teachers, to minimise disruption of classes due to the prototype. This would only be possible if the school budget would to increase.
- We could record the noise level of individual students, but would require much expansion, over-complication, and over-development of product, won’t be sustainable.


## Conclusion
eduServeSG is a promising start to reducing noise and its effects, providing a nice and quiet environment to work and study in.
In the future, we hope to improve EduserveSG further, and we hope the school can afford such a financial burden
Hopefully, our project can revolutionise schools, perhaps even acting as a gateway for other intriguing and helpful ideas to come about.


## Acknowledgements
We had a really interesting time with this project, and learnt a lot from this experience.
We would like to thank the following:
* **Liang Jun (a friend)** for providing information on pyaudio
* Our **team members** for putting their best effort! They were certainly... a treat to work with haha.
